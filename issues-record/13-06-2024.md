## Initial Request: get cop vpn approved in macos apple developer account for macos devices

- App icon in bottom bar is not correct.
- no app icon in top bar
- VPN does not stop on app close
- on app restart, it does not show that the VPN is already working, the browser does, mean in browser the IP is changed showing that VPN is working, but in app it's not connected.
